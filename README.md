# Dog-breed Classifier

This notebook is part of a project for Deep Learning Nanodegree from Udacity.

This notebook contains:
* Human detector funtion (using haarcascades)
* Dog detector (using VGG16 pretrained in ImageNet dataset)
* CNN Model to classify Dog Breeds (from Scratch)
* CNN Model to classify Dog Breeds (using Transfer Learning - VGG16 used)
* Algorithm to combine and run app as a whole
* Testing
